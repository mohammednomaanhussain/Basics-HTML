            <h1>about</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>First Car Ever: The world's first true automobile was built by Karl Benz in 1885-1886. It was a motorized three-wheeler called the Benz Patent-Motorwagen.</li>
                <li>Airbags: The first commercially available airbag system was introduced by General Motors in the 1970s. However, they were only available in a few luxury models. It wasn't until the 1990s that airbags became a standard safety feature.</li>
                <li>Windshield Wipers: Mary Anderson, an American inventor, is credited with inventing the first operational windshield wiper in 1903. Her invention was a manually operated lever system that drivers could control.</li>
                <li>Annual Car Production: Over 70 million cars are produced worldwide annually, as of the most recent data available. China is the largest car producer, followed by the United States and Japan.</li>
                <li>Horsepower Origins: The term "horsepower" was coined by engineer James Watt to market his steam engines. He wanted to relate the power output of his engines to the work done by horses, a unit of measurement people were familiar with at the time.
